def mod_congruent(a, n):
    '''
    The congruence relation between positve integer n, and two integers a and b
    such that a ≡ b (mod n)
    '''
    print(f"{a} ≡ {a % n} (mod {n})")
    pass

def mod_inverse(a, n):
    '''
    The modular multiplicative inverse of an integer a is an integer x such that
    the product ax is congruent to 1 with respect to the modulus n.
    This can be written as ax ≡ 1 (mod n)
